# Planting a Tree - My First Blog Post

I've actually been thinking about starting a blog for a while now. 

Well, not a blog persay, but just a place for me to dump all my thoughts about what I'm learning (I guess this just happens to be almost exactly what a blog is).

The thing that finally prompted me to do this was from this book I am reading with my lab entitled [Deep Learning for Coders with fastai and PyTorch: AI Applications Without a PhD](https://course.fast.ai) by Jeremy Howard and Sylvain Gugger. 
In Chapter 2, they suggested making a blog about one's learning experience with machine learning and whatnot; so here I am.

Sometimes I feel like I should have started organizing my thoughts about what I am learning a long time ago - there are a lot of things from my undergrad (chemical and biological engineering) that I have forgotten because I didn't connect them to my larger knowledge base. 
Instead, I just studied what I needed to know for my exams, and promptly forgot all about them (I feel like this is often the classic engineering student experience). 

And I don't mean I wish I kept detailed notes about fluid dynamics or organic chemistry or anything, I just wish I kept some **summary of the key points of what I learned**. 
My thinking is that if I memorized or had easy access to these high-level concepts, then I could easily connect new things I am learning to my existing "tree of knowledge". From what I can tell, that's my ideal learning style. I think I watched a video somewhere about how Elon Musk said that's how his brain works, but whatever - I'm not doing this to copy Elon, I'm doing this for me.

Anyways, of course it would have been lovely if I started some high-level-notetaking/thought-organization system a long time ago, but there is no point in feeling sorry and not doing anything about it. 
I might as well just start now, by blogging about my learning experience and how it relates to other things I've learned or what is on my mind. 

It really kinda ties into one of my favourite quotes of all time: 
> The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time, is now. - Chinese Proverb

The best time for me to organize all the things I've learned and reflect on them was a long time ago; oh well, I might as well start now!
